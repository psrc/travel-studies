![delivery_2022.png](delivery_2022.png){width=50%}

## Scope of 2024 analysis:

1. organize delivery questions across the years
    - [ ] add documentation to wiki
2. answer question: share of households receiving packages/services in a typical weekday
    - find a way to calculate as a household-day
    - try: number of days (or number of) packages / number of valid weekdays
3. demographics:
    - [ ] household income
    - [ ] lifecycle (with/without kids)
    - [ ] home location in RGC
4. relationships between
    - telework
    - VMT
    - delivery
    - (shopping trips: we don't know weekend trips)
5. where do households with deliveries live?
    - spatial analysis
