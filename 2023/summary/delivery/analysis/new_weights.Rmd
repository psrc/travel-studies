## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
new_weights<-read.csv( 'J:/Projects/Surveys/HHTravel/Survey2023/Data/weighting/no_roommate_adj_test/hh_weights.csv')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
hh_new_weights<-left_join(hh, new_weights, by='hh_id', suffix=c('old', 'new'))%>%filter(survey_year==
                                                                                         '2023')
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
hh_new_weights_summary<-hh_new_weights%>%replace(is.na(.),0)%>%                                              group_by(hhsize,vehicle_count)%>%summarize(old_weights=sum(hh_weightold),
                                                                      new_weights=sum(hh_weightnew))
```
```{r}
hh_new_weights_summary
```
generated the plot.
```{r}
hh_new_weights_summary_veh<-hh_new_weights%>%replace(is.na(.),0)%>%                                              group_by(hhsize,vehicle_count)%>%summarize(old_weights=sum(hh_weightold),
                                                                      new_weights=sum(hh_weightnew))
```
```{r}
hh_new_weights_summary_veh
```
