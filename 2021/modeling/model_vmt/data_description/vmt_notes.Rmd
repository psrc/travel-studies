## Goal
gap remains in understanding the processes and policies that cities can adopt to reduce their reliance on cars

- **the variables that correlate with household vehicle miles traveled**. Fine out how weekday household vehicle miles travelled relates to household, land use, and cost characteristics
    
- look into the value of employer commuter benefits- such as- can we measure the impact on vehicle miles traveled of an employer offering 1)free parking 2)free transit pass
- find a statistical model that can analyze the the sensitivity of the interventions
  
## Model concept

some type of multidimensional model: a sketch model to bound our expectations about what changing a particular variable could have on vehicle miles traveled (**elasticity**)

- potential datasets and correlation variables: **household travel survey data, local land use data, Census data** 
  - land use: residential density, distance to transit stops/workplace (regional accessibility to jobs and jobs-housing balance), 
  - household income, 
  - having a transit pass given by work, having telecommute available to you
  - generalized accessibility measures)

## Research direction

1. Look into research implementing household travel survey data, local land use data, Census data
2. What model forms and why?
3. _Summarize higher quality research into short notes (like 4 sentences)_
4. 10 pages notes


# Research Approach

## data description

- gather data, info on Washington State legislation on ghg emission
- vmt distribution across the region and socioeconomic groups
- control socioeconomic characteristics: compare behaviors of people in same social group, but in different regions
